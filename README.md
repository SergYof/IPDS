## What is IDS?

**IDS** is a lightweight, extensible network intrusion detection system featuring a live GUI, modular detection engine, and real-time alerting. It is designed for rapid prototyping, educational use, and easy extension with new detection modules ("cracks").

---

## Key Features & Benefits

- **Live network monitoring** with a modern Tkinter GUI ([gui.py](gui.py))
- **Multiple built-in detectors**:
  - Port scan detection ([cracks/portscan.py](cracks/portscan.py))
  - ARP spoof/mitm detection ([cracks/arpspoof.py](cracks/arpspoof.py))
  - DNS spoof detection ([cracks/dnsspoof.py](cracks/dnsspoof.py))
- **Modular "crack" interface** for easy extension ([cracks/base.py](cracks/base.py))
- **In-process buses** for packets and alerts ([bus/packet_bus.py](bus/packet_bus.py), [bus/alert_bus.py](bus/alert_bus.py))
- **GeoIP lookup** support ([utils/geoip.py](utils/geoip.py))
- **Small, readable codebase** for learning and experimentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (Windows recommended; Linux/macOS may work)
- Administrative privileges (for packet capture)
- [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) (Windows) or equivalent packet capture driver

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	python -m pip install scapy geoip2
	```
2. (Optional) For GeoIP support, download the MaxMind GeoLite2-City.mmdb and place it in the project root or update [utils/geoip.py](utils/geoip.py) to your DB path.

### Configuration

- Edit the capture interface in [main.py](main.py) if needed (see the `IFACE` constant or interface selection logic).

### Usage

Start the application:

```sh
python main.py
```

The GUI will launch automatically, displaying live alerts and packet streams. Alerts are published to the GUI via [bus/alert_bus.py](bus/alert_bus.py).

## Example: Adding a New Detector

To add your own detection module, subclass `Crack` from [cracks/base.py](cracks/base.py) and implement the `on_packet` or `on_flow` methods. See [cracks/arpspoof.py](cracks/arpspoof.py) or [cracks/portscan.py](cracks/portscan.py) for examples.

*This project is for educational and research purposes. Use responsibly and only on networks you own or have permission to monitor.*
- Packet processing and detection are in `manager.py` and detectors in `cracks/`.
- The project uses Scapy for packet parsing. On Windows, install Npcap (https://nmap.org/npcap/) and run Python with administrator privileges to capture packets.
